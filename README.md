# Advent of Code 2023

This repository holds the scripts I used for
[https://adventofcode.com/2023](Advent of Code 2023).

To solve the challenges I use POSIX shell and phython. All code is commented for
educational purposes. Keep in mind however that the aim of these scripts is to
solve the presented problems. They do not reflect best practices when coding,
nor are they representative of my general coding style. Quick-and-dirty is the
name of the game.
